Step by Step Installation:
1. Download and install the Java Software Development Kit (JDK)
2. Download latest version of "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers"
3. Download Selenium Webdriver for Java Client Driver. You will find client drivers for other languages there, but only choose the one for Java.
For simplicity of Selenium installation on Windows 10, extract the contents of this ZIP file on your C drive so that you would have the directory "C:\selenium-java-3.141.59\". This directory contains all the JAR files that we would later import on Eclipse for Selenium setup.
4. Import the project to eclipse
5. Please check all the required libraries are properly imported
6. Run the project
